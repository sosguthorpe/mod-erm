/**
 * KBCache. the interface into the KB cache that adapters will call to notify changes
 *
 * The domain model of this app can be thought of as a local cache of multiple external knowledgebases (KBs)
 * the term KB is problematic, as it can refer in turn to
 *     The "KB" of everything thats been published, by whom and when, including title histories and other info (Publications KB?)
 *     The "KB" of how publications are packaged and bundled for sale by content providers (Packaging KB?)
 *     The "KB" of what I think I have bought (What titles, coverage, terms), from where and for how long (PCA)
 *
 * This interface defines interface which a class must implement in order to collect information from a remote KB
 * and update the local KB Cache.
 *
 * These methods are very likely candidates for participation in workflow - or rather the trigger for workflow events
 * We're trying to pre-guess how some of that might work out here.
 *
 * This document: https://docs.google.com/document/d/14KIi4Guhu8r1NM7lr8NH6SI7giyAdmFjjy4Q6x-MMvQ/edit
 * Drive -> ERM-Project Team -> WorkInProgress -> olf-erm analysis and design -> PackageDescription--JSON format
 * sets out some thoughts on the format of JSON documents describing some of this.
